# Directory Coloring by Globs

*An alternate directory segment for [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)*

The idea behind this plugin is
taking the "anchors" used by the original `dir` segment to their logical end.

In essence, with this plugin we can use globs
to make arbitrary tests on each parent directory;
colorizing based on ownership, permissions, existence of files,
and more.
